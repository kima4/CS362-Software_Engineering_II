# CS362-Software_Engineering_II
Portfolio project for CS362 at Oregon State University


The portfolio project for this class was not a programming assignment, but rather a paper to reflect on my experience working in a group during the class. In it, I discuss previous team project, my experience working with Continuous Integration, and any lessons for the future I learned during the project.
